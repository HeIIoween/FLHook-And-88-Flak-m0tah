Soundtrack Information
Just click yes here.
Be sure to check out the 88 Flak Soundtrack! Tired of Freelancer's default music? Want something a little more fitting to the combat of 88 Flak? Give this a spin. I'd strongly recommend that you first download and install this before you play 88 Flak for the first time, as the music has been hand-picked for atmosphere and is a subtle but important part of the mod.
