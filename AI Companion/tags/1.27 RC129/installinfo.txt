Other Semi-Important Information
Just click yes here.
Be sure to check out the 88 Flak Soundtrack! Tired of Freelancer's default music? Want something a little more fitting to the combat of 88 Flak? Give this a spin. I'd strongly recommend that you first download this and install it before you play Flak for the first time, however I suppose it all lies in musical taste.
Download it at:

Now that you've read this semi-important information, click yes. Have fun! =)
