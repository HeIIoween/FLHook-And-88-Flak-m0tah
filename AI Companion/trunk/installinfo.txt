Other Semi-Important Information
Just click yes here.
Be sure to check out the 88 Flak Soundtrack! Tired of Freelancer's default music? Want something a little more fitting to the combat of 88 Flak? Give this a spin. I'd strongly recommend that you first download this and install it before you play Flak for the first time, however I suppose it all lies in musical taste.
Download it at:

For more information, please view the credits section of the 88 Flak Readme.

Finally, 88 Flak makes heavy use of the afterburner (default TAB). Since TAB is an awkward key to hold for extended periods of time, it is highly recommended you change your afterburner key to something more accessable. Ctrl+W and Middle Mouse are both excellent keys to use for afterburner.

Now that you've read this semi-important information, click yes. Have fun! =)
