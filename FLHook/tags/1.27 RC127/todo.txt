- Take a look at NPC collision damage issues, switch back to doing collision damage instead of gun damage
- Add feature that makes the hull be damaged instead of equipment

Old crap:
- Fix mine jumping lag bug
- have player kills log a "follow_trigger_ship" archetype_killed if possible
- possibly have Hook .kill torpedoes launched at a velocity > 400m/s?
- dockkill/apvptoken protection messages for when you shoot a player
- Rep changes for station deaths (bug M0tah)
- additional combat-only logout delay so I can make logging out in combat even longer
- Constant impulse for spin protection instead of single call?
