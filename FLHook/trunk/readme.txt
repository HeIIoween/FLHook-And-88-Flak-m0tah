=============
version: 1.6.6
Based on FLHook v1.5.5 with w0dk4's cloak code

NOTE: If you wish to use this version of FLHook in place of your standard 1.5.5,
please read the changelog.  The default FLHook.ini works with vanilla FL; for
an example of a config file for a mod, look at FLHook Flak.ini ('88 Flak's
config file).

================================================================================
== INSTALLATION ================================================================
================================================================================
FLHOOK ONLY WORKS WITH FLSERVER 1.1. USING IT WITH 1.0 WILL CRASH FLSERVER!!!

copy the files from "bin" to your freelancer/exe directory and edit the FLHook.ini
in order to suite your needs.
there are 3 different ways to start flhook:
1) open dacomsrv.ini in "...\freelancer\exe" and append FLHook.dll to the 
   [Libraries] section. flserver will load flhook whenever you start it.
2) execute FLHookStart.exe while flserver.exe is already running. this will
   inject FLHook into the running process.
3) execute FLHookStart.exe with "execute ..." as command line. this will start
   flserver.exe along with FLHook. the rest of the command line will be passed
   on to the server. FLHook console will be shown as soon as the loading-process
   has finished
(note: the old patch is not needed anymore, use 1) instead)

================================================================================
== CONFIG ======================================================================
================================================================================
take a look at the comments in FLHook.ini

================================================================================
== ADMIN-COMMANDS ==============================================================
================================================================================
commands can be executed by administrators in several ways:
- using the FLHook console(-> access to all commands)
- ingame by typing .command in the chat(e.g. .getcash Player1)
  this will only work when you own the appropriate rights which may be set via
  the setadmin command. FLHook will store the rights of each player in his
  account-directory in flhookadmin.ini.
- via a socket connection in raw text mode(e.g. with putty)
  connect to the port given in the FLHook.ini and enter "PASS password". after
  having successfully logged in you may enter all of the commands you want(as
  long as you have the necessary rights). you may have several socket connections
  at the same time. exiting the connection may be done by entering "quit" or simply
  by closing it.

- CASH -
all cash functions work no matter if the player is currently logged in or not
getcash <charname>
  shows current account balance of <charname>
setcash <charname> <amount>
  sets current account balance of <charname> to <amount>
setcashsec <charname> <oldmoney> <amount>
  sets current account balance of <charname> to <amount>, only works when his old account balance is <oldmoney>
addcash <charname> <amount>
  adds <amount> to the current account balance of <charname>
addcashsec <charname> <oldmoney> <amount>
  adds <amount> to the current account balance of <charname>, only works when his old account balance is <oldmoney>

- KICK/BAN -
kick <charname> <reason>
  disconnects <charname>. the user will be displayed <reason>, if it is specified.
ban <charname>
  bans <charname>'s account
  <charname> stays connected if he's currently on the server
unban <charname>
  unbans <charname>'s account
kickban <charname> <reason>
  kicks and bans <charname> (2 in 1, same as kick <charname> <reason>, ban <charname>)

- MSG -
msg <charname> <text>
  private message <text> to <charname> (shown as "Console: <text>")
msgs <systemname> <text>
  send <text> to all players in <systemname> (shown as "Console: <text>")
  <systemname> must be the either the system-id or the shortname (like Li01)
msgu <text>
  message <text> to the whole universe
msguc <text>
  message <text> to the whole universe (shown as "Console: <text>")
fmsg <charname> <xmltext>
  private message <xmltext> to <charname> (see XMLTEXT section for further details)
fmsgs <systemname> <xmltext>
  send <xmltext> to all players in <systemname> (see XMLTEXT section for further details)
fmsgu <xmltext>
  message <xmltext> to the whole universe (see XMLTEXT section for further details)

- BEAM/KILL -
beam <charname> <basename>
  force <charname> to land on <basename> (player must be in space)
  <basename> must be either the shortname(like Li01_01_Base for Manhattan) or a shortcut defined in the FLHook.ini
  Player may be kicked after beam
  note: see the issues section below
kbeam <charname> <basename>
  Kills <charname>, respawning them at <basename> when they click RESPAWN
  As long as the player respawns after dying, they will not lose any cargo
  This is meant as a replacement for beam, which sometimes kicks a player
kill [charname]
  kills [charname] if it is defined, otherwise kills object selected in HUD
instantdock <charname>
  Instantly docks <charname> to the selected object in HUD; note that the object and <charname> must be in the same system

- REPUTATION -
resetrep <charname>
  sets <charname>'s reputations to the one specified in "mpnewcharacter.fl"
setrep <charname> <repgroup> <value>
  set <charname>'s reputation for <repgroup> to <value>. <value> should be between -1 and 1.
  example:
  "setrep playerxy li_n_grp 0.7"
  -> set playerxy's reputation for liberty navy to 0.7
setreprelative <charname> <repgroup> <value>
  Adjust <charname>'s reputation with <repgroup> by <value>.
  Works like when you kill a NPC - the reps with all the other factions are adjusted as well.
getrep <charname> <repgroup>
  get <charname>'s reputation for <repgroup>.
  getrep playerxy li_n_grp returns "rep=0.1223", for example.
getaffiliation <charname>
  gets <charname>'s affiliation; returns "repgroup=li_n_grp", for example.
setaffiliation <charname> <repgroup>
  sets <charname>'s affiliation

- CARGO -
All cargo commands except for addcargo only work when the targeted player is ingame
enumcargo <charname>
  lists <charname>'s cargo, first reply will be the remaining hold size
addcargo <charname> <good> <count> <mission>
  adds <count> numbers of <good>(shortname like co_gun01_mark02,commodity_silver,etc OR hash) to <charname>'s cargo
  if <mission> is set to 1, the cargo is declared as mission cargo
addcargom <charname> <good> <hardpoint> <mission>
  Same as above except the cargo is mounted to <hardpoint>.
removecargo <charname> <id> <count>
  removes <count> numbers of <id>(this must be the value from enumcargo's "id=" reply) from <charname>

- CHARACTERS -
rename <oldcharname> <newcharname>
  rename <oldcharname> to <newcharname> (player will be kicked if he's logged in <oldcharname>'s account)

  delete <charname> (player will be kicked if he's logged in <oldcharname>'s account)
readcharfile <charname>
  reads <charname>'s userfile(xxx.fl) and prints it(each line will be preceded by "l ")
writecharfile <charname> <data>
  writes <data> into <charname>'s userfile(xxx.fl). existing charfile will be overwritten. you should
  be careful with this one because a corrupted charfile may lead to server crashes and flhook does 
  not do any syntax checks on <data>.
  NOTE: YOU MUST REPLACE LINE-WRAPS WITH \n(TEXT)
  example:
  writecharfile playerxy [Player]\ndescription = 00300034002f0031003\n\n ... etc.

- SETTINGS -
setadmin <charname> <rights>
  set <charname> as ingame-admin with <rights> (affects all characters on the account) (see RIGHTS section below)
getadmin <charname>
  show <charname>'s rights
deladmin <charname>

setadminrestriction <charname> <restriction>
  Only allow <charname> to execute admin commands on characters with names that include <restriction>.
getadminrestriction <charname>
  Gets the admin restriction for <charname>; returns "restriction=[blarg]", for example.
rehash
  reload the flhook.ini in order to activate changed settings, this works for everything except the socket-settings
unload
  unload flhook(flserver will keep on running flawlessly)
  this is very useful since it allows you to install a new flhook version on-the-fly. simply unload, replace the files
  and execute FLHookStart.exe
  the command will kick players with an active moneyfixlist(don't bother).

- GROUP -
getgroupmembers <charname>
  returns all players which are in a group with <charname>
getgroup <charname>
  gets the group-id of <charname>; returns "groupid=2", for example.
  players in no group have a group-id of 0.
addtogroup <charname> <group>
  adds <charname> to <group>
invitetogroup <charname> <fromcharname>
  invites <charname> to join <fromcharname>'s group

  shutdown the server.  NOTE: requires that the server have taskkill installed (is not installed
  by default on XP Home).
spawns [on|off]
  Turns NPC spawns on or off.
help
  get a list of all commands
  
- MISC INFOS -
you can use client-ids instead of <charname> by appending $ to the cmd.  Using $ for the client-id means use your own.
examples: 
getcash$ 12
kickban$ 1
getplayerinfo$ $
etc.

you can also use "shortcuts" instead of the whole character-name for a currently logged in player by appending
& to the cmd. FLHook traverses all logged in players and checks if their character-name contains
<charname>(case insensitive) and if so, the command will operate on this player. an error will be shown if the 
searchstring given in <charname> is ambiguous.
examples (let's assume there are 2 players logged in: "superhax0r" and "..::[]SUPERNERD[]::.."):
"kick& nerd" kicks "..::[]SUPERNERD[]::.." because his nick contains "nerd"
"getcash& super" fails because there are multiple character names containing "super"

all commands return "OK" when successful or "ERR <errortext>" when error occured

================================================================================
== RIGHTS ======================================================================
================================================================================
rights may be separated by a comma (e.g. setadmin playerxy cash,kickban,msg)
superadmin        -> everything
cash              -> cash commands
kickban           -> kick/ban/group commands
beam              -> beam/kill/resetrep/setrep command
msg               -> msg commands
savechar          -> savechar command
cargo             -> cargo commands
chars             -> rename/deletechar/readcharfile/writecharfile
eventmode         -> eventmode (only when connected via socket)
all other commands except setadmin/getadmin/deladmin/restartserver/shutdownserver/spawns may be executed by all admins

================================================================================
== XMLTEXT =====================================================================
================================================================================

the fmsg* commands allow you to format text in several ways(like in the exe\misctext.dll)
text is enclosed in <TEXT></TEXT> tags while the format can be changed with <TRA .../>
nodes-names must be written in capital chars! 
be sure to replace the following characters within a text-node:
< -> &#60; 
> -> &#62;
& -> &#38;

- <TRA .../> NODE SYNTAX -
the data field of a TRA node consists of an RGB value along with format specifications:
<TRA data="0xBBGGRRFF" mask="-1"/>
BB is the blue value
GG is the green value
RR is the red value
FF is the format value
(all in hexadecimal representation)

format flags are:
bin      hex  dec  effect
00000001 1    1    bold
00000010 2    2    italic
00000100 4    4    underline
00001000 8    8    big
00010000 10   16   big&wide
00100000 20   32   very big
01000000 40   64   smoothest?
10000000 80   128  smoother?
10010000 90   144  small
simply add the flags to combine them (e.g. 7 = bold/italic/underline)

examples:
fmsgu <TRA data="0x1919BD01" mask="-1"/><TEXT>A player has died: Player</TEXT>
this is similar to the standard die-msg(which is shown in bold)
fmsgu <TRA data="0xFF000003" mask="-1"/><TEXT>Hello</TEXT><TRA data="0x00FF0008" mask="-1"/> <TEXT>World</TEXT>
this will show "Hello World" ("Hello" will be blue/bold/italic and "World" green/big)

================================================================================
== EVENTMODE ===================================================================
================================================================================
socket connections may be set to eventmode by entering "eventmode". from then on 
you will receive several event-notifications listed below. once activated, 
eventmode runs until you close the connection.

================================================================================
== LOGGING =====================================================================
================================================================================
flhook logfiles are created in "My Documents\My Games\Freelancer\Accts\MultiPlayer".

flhook_kicks.log:
  idle-/ping-/loss-/corruptedcharfile-/ipban-/hostban-kicks
flhook_cheaters.log:
  detected cheating

there is also a flhook.log file in the exe dir. it mainly contains debug data.
so don't care about this one.

================================================================================
== SPECIAL FEATURES ============================================================
================================================================================
- Cloak by w0dk4: adds a balanced cloaking system to FLHook. Cloaking devices 
  and cloaking times are defined in the ini under [CloakDevices].
- Repair guns: guns that repair instead of damage ships and solars. They are 
  defined in the ini under [RepairGuns].
- Alternate base repairing: bases whose hit points match the list defined under
  [BaseRepair] in the ini are not repaired for the first half the time set and 
  then are repaired completely during the second half of the set time. The time 
  can be set in the ini under [General]; it is 240 seconds by default.  If the
  base is killed while being repaired the cycle restarts at the end of the set
  time.  The base can only be repaired by its hit points, so if it is damaged
  while being repaired it will not be repaired all the way.
- Automatic changing of affiliation: when the mountable faction tags present in
  the 88 Flak mod are bought from a base and are mounted automatically after 
  being bought, the affiliation of the player who bought the tag is changed to
  that of the tag. Note that for this to work the nickname of the faction tag 
  must have "_grp_token" in it, be the nickname of the faction it represents 
  with a "_token" appended to it, and be defined in misc_equip.ini.
- Mobile docking: allows players to dock with other players.  The valid ships
  can be set under [MobileBases] in the ini.  Ships cannot dock with other ships
  on the list.  In order for mobile docking to function, there must be a base in
  every system with a nickname and base name of <system nick>_mobile_proxy_base.
  Players will be instantly docked at this base when /dock (/d) is executed on a
  valid ship and that ship is in range (settable in ini under 
  [General]->MobileDockRadius).  The distance under or over the carrier the
  player is launched at can be configured in the ini under
  [General]->MobileDockOffset.  Players must be in the same group in order to dock.

================================================================================
== KNOWN ISSUES ================================================================
================================================================================
- crashes/performance:
  FLHook is very resistant to server crashes. we've had it running on hhc for
  weeks without any major problems. however in case you encounter any crashes
  which are obviously related to FLHook please contact me.
- the standard beam command can cause the server to crash.  This is why this
  version of FLHook has a setting allowing configuration of the .beam command.
  By default it is set to use the improvements made by w0dk4 in the plugin
  version.  Look at [General]->BeamCmdBehavior for the setting and more
  information.
- the sender in the standard chat messages appear a little bit smaller when
  "/set chatfont" is enabled
- calculation of the "loss" has been improved but is still problematic. players with
  low bandwidth tend to have a very high loss while they're loading, so this may
  lead to some problems. i don't recommend using the loss-kick at this moment.

================================================================================
== SOURCE CODE =================================================================
================================================================================
FLHook compiles on both vc7 and vc6
Note:
flserver uses string-class arguments in some of its functions(f. e. 
PlayerDB::FindAccountFromCharacterName(...)). when you compile since FLHook with 
vc7, which uses a different stl, you can't simply pass strings. that's why
i created the FLHookWString.dll which was compiled with vc6 and just exports
two functions to create/delete flserver compatible strings. if you don't have
vc6 installed then use the FLHookWString.dll from bin and thats it.

if you want the full header files/libs of all of the relevant flserver dlls then 
take a look at FLCoreSDK(www.skif.be). it contains everything you need.
Since www.skif.be has disappeared, w0dk4 has mirrored the DL at
http://aa-flserver.de/download/FLCoreSDK.zip .

please note:
I WILL NOT TEACH YOU HOW TO CODE, I WILL NOT TELL YOU HOW TO REVERSE FLSERVER 
AND I WILL NOT REPLY TO "STUPID" QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SOURCE - mc_horst
w0dk4 and M0tah however are generally willing to try and answer questions regarding
the source/FLHook in general.  The FLHook forum can be found at
http://flhook.drachennest200x.de/forum/ .

================================================================================
== BLOWFISH ENCRYPTION PROGRAMMING =============================================
================================================================================
Because Blowfish only supports encrypting 8 bytes of data at once, it is
necessary to pad data (with 0x00s) that is not a multiple of 8 bytes.  When
recieving encrypted data from FLHook, you should check for null characters and
remove them from the decrypted string.  When sending encrypted data to FLHook,
you should pad the string with null characters if necessary.  If the blowfish
implementation you are using specifically encrypts and decrypts strings, this
