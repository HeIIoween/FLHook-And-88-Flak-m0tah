------ Information ------
This list was originally compiled by Dev in the Lancers Reactor topic Limit Breaking 101.
I have since taken up the liberty of un-officially organizing this list, and documenting any new offsets I come across. If you find new values that could be of use, please contribute them and they will be added to the list.

Please note all offsets are for 1.1 patch DLLs only. If you do not use the 1.1 patch in your mod, you can easily upgrade with this stand-alone zip file containing all 1.1 patch items: http://www.memes.no/88flak/downloads/beta/flpatch.zip

Layout:
(file name)	(1.1 offset)	(default value) = (description)

(default value) meanings:
f = float, 4 bytes
d = double, 8 bytes
i = integer, 4 bytes
b = byte, 1 byte (-128 to 127)
Any other value with no suffix means a hexadecimal value. Thus, a value like "0F85->90E9" means replace the original bytes on the left with the new bytes on the right.

======
Visibility
======
freelancer.exe	210530	3f = near plane of view frustum ~Dev
freelancer.exe	210534	250000f = far plane of view frustum (nothing will be drawn beyond this) ~Dev
freelancer.exe	213EC8	10000f = maximum draw distance for some bases (like battleships) ~FriendlyFire
freelancer.exe	1C8910	20000f = same offset as below, max distance at which ships can be seen (even if lodranges specify a higher distance) ~Dev
freelancer.exe	1C8910	20000f = same offset as above, poly flipping distance - raising this value stops graphical glitches on big CMPs, but raising it too high introduces flickering issues with SPH-based models (like planets) ~FriendlyFire
freelancer.exe	1D15B8	100000000f = square of max distance that a ship can be selected ~Dev
server.dll	086AEC	6250000f = square of NPC disappear distance in MP ~Dev
server.dll	086AF0	25000000f = square of player disappear distance in MP ~Dev
server.dll	086AF4	100000000f = square of grouped player disappear distance in MP ~Dev

content.dll	117A68	7500f = distance over which NPC spawning will ignore density cap in MP (in other words, players within this distance to another player will "share spawns" with that player, and must move this distance away from other players for FLServer to start spawning NPCs for him/her) ~Dev
======
NPC Spawning: Patrol Path
======
content.dll	118578	200f = multiplier for patrol_path spawn distances, double this to double patrol_path spawn ranges; use this in tandem with below to raise patrol_path spawn ranges ~Vital

content.dll	0BB1DA	2000f = distance from the zone (or from the edge of the patrol_path) that encounters begin to spawn - this is not from the center of the patrol; if your patrol has a radius of 750, encounters will spawn 2750 away from the central axis of the patrol; if your zone is a sphere with 4000 radius encounters start spawning 6000 (4000 + 2000) away from the centre of the zone ~Vital
content.dll	0C48D7	2500f = distance that patrol_path NPCs spawn when players are close to each other in patrol path (so far seems like closer than 300m) ~Vital

content.dll	11BB58	1200f = distance from the last tradelane ring that patrol path NPCs are created (2750 and more, no NPCs are created, unless patrol_path spawn distance is raised?) ~Vital
content.dll	0C5D53	3750f = distance from the tradelane ring (except the nearest one) at which NPCs with arrival = tradelane encounters are created (negative numbers accepted, though terminal rings will act up) - there are more 3750f in content.dll which may be relevant ~Vital
content.dll	0C2946	5000i = minimum spawn distance for tradelane NPCs, tradelane spawns below this distance will be rejected and transferred to the next ring instead ~Vital

content.dll	1195D4	25000000f = square of the distance from the end of the patrol_path to the object over which patrol_path NPCs won't dock with it (so far tested only with jumpgates; raising this may prevent PP crashes?) ~Vital
common.dll	07AE5E	200f = unknown, increasing this to 1000f and more makes patrol_path NPCs stand still after spawn (side note by fox: this range seems to also denote the range which MsnRandEnc ships spawned with story scripting cut cruise and engage targets; if you're spawning ships with MsnRandEnc, try increasing this to make them more combat-effective) ~Vital
common.dll	13E6D0	1.5f = autopilot helper value used by all AI functions, including NPC maneuvering and player autopilot; generally, set lower for a more accurate and picky autopilot (beware, has massive effect on how AI handle and may break your NPCs, so be very careful!) ~fox

content.dll	117608	300f = multiplier for zone distance; increase to allow randommissions further from base ~adoxa
content.dll	12E778	30f = return to battle time (SP) ~adoxa
content.dll	11C2DC	45f = return to battle time (MP) ~adoxa
content.dll	0ECED5	5f = return to battle update interval ~adoxa
