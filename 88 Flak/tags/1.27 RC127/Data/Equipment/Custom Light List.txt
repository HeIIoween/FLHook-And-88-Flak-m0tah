Light list. To hell with just docking lights.

I will have lights like this:

Main Lights
Docking Lights
Misc. Lights (CSV antenna, etc.)

contrail01 - Yes, I will allow people to choose one hell of a lot of contrails if they want. Since lights are located at the tips of wings, etc. usually, this will look fine.

LargeWhiteSpecial - This will not be chooseable as a light. I used it as a 'default' CSV antenna light, though, because if I used 'SlowSmallWhite' like I normally did players wouldn't get to choose their antenna light. And saying that's the one ship I've seen with a different light than the rest (excluding headlights), I think it deserves it. =P
DockingLightRed - Yes, I will allow people to light up like the Fourth of July when docking.
DockingLightRedSmall - Same here. =P
DockingLightWhite - I have yet to decide if I'll include these for normal lights. I kinda like them on JUST the docking light fixtures, for various reasons.
