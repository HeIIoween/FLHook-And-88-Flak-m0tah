-------- Information --------
This list was originally compiled by Dev in the Lancers Reactor topic Limit Breaking 101.
Credit for finding the original offsets go to Dev. All of these were found by him unless credited otherwise at the end of the line.
I have since taken up the liberty of un-officially organizing this list, and documenting any new offsets I come across. If you find new values that could be of use, please contribute them and they will be added to the list.
While I attempted to find a 1.0 dll offset for useful variables I came across (I operate off 1.1 dlls), please excuse any variables that were found in 1.1 DLLs only. Finding these offsets is a pain.

freelancer.exe is not changed in the 1.1 patch, leaving all offsets the same for freelancer.exe.
Offsets in server.dll, common.dll, and content.dll are changed, however.

(default value) in (file), (1.0 hex offset), (1.1 hex offset) = (description)

-------- Visibility --------
-- 3f in freelancer.exe, 0x210530, 0x210530 = near plane of view frustum
-- 250000f in freelancer.exe, 0x210534, 0x210534 = far plane of view frustum (nothing will be drawn beyond this)
-- 10000f in freelancer.exe, 0x213EC8, 0x213EC8 = maximum draw distance for some bases (like battleships) ~FriendlyFire
-- 20000f in freelancer.exe, 0x1C8910, 0x1C8910 = same offset as below, max distance at which ships can be seen (even if lodranges specify a higher distance)
-- 20000f in freelancer.exe, 0x1C8910, 0x1C8910 = same offset as above, poly flipping distance - raising this value stops graphical glitches on big CMPs, but raising it too high introduces flickering issues with SPH-based models (like planets) ~FriendlyFire
-- 100000000f in freelancer.exe, 0x1D15B8, 0x1D15B8 = square of max distance that a ship can be selected

-- 6250000f in server.dll, 0x84ADC, 0x86AEC = square of distance from the center of the system over which bases no longer wish you well when un-docking (note: this is the same number as NPC disappear distance - as long as you have a good NPC persistence range, and good loot_unseen_radius = (radius) & loot_unseen_life_time = (time outside radius) in constants.ini, increasing this is safe) ~fox
-- 0x77->0xEB in freelancer.exe, 0x5B029, 0x5B029 = force "%s System." IDS (1373 in resources.dll) to be used for all system arrival text (no house is displayed) ~M0tah

-- 0x83FFFFFCFF83F8->0x9B01000000EB2D in freelancer.exe, 0x5B021, 0x5B021 = make system arrival text the system's IDS +1 (be sure to also change IDS 1373 to just "%s") ~M0tah
-- 1.74f in common.dll, 0x13DFAC, 0x13DFDC - multiplier for fill_dist in CmnAsteroid::CAsteroidField::near_field calculation, increase this to make FL render asteroid fields from greater distances ~w0dk4 (~OutCast for 1.1 version of offset)

-- 7500f in content.dll, 0x116A68, 0x117A68 = distance over which NPC spawning will ignore density cap in MP - in other words, players within this distance to another player will "share spawns" with that player, and must move this distance away from other players for FLServer to start spawning NPCs for him/her
-- 2000f in content.dll, 0x?????, 0xBB1DA = distance from the patrol zone that patrol_path encounters begin to spawn (this is not from the middle of the patrol; if your patrol has a width of 750, encounters will spawn 2375 - 2750 away from the patrol; if your patrol has a width of 1, encounters will spawn 2000 away from it) ~Vital
-- 2500f in content.dll, 0xC4A44, 0xC4974 = patrol_path NPC min spawn distance check; patrol_path spawns below this distance will be rejected, use this in tandem with above to make sure all spawns are within good spawning ranges ~fox
-- 2500f in content.dll, 0x11B2C4, 0x11C2C4 = distance at which NPC mission target ships in randommissions are created ~Vital
-- 2625f in content.dll, 0x?????, 0xF17D9 = distance at which NPC wave ships in randommissions are created ~Vital

-- 10000f in server.dll, 0xA5AF0, 0xA8AF0 = maximum AI firing range ~FriendlyFire
-- 5000f in content.dll, 0xD0510 and 0x11AD10, 0xD0630 and 0x11BD10 = max range at which NPCs will go hostile upon seeing their allies go hostile (both values must be changed)

-- 2500f in content.dll, 0x6CA37, 0x6C717 = max range at which NPCs will initiate scan of your cargo
-- 50f in common.dll, 0x??????, 0x13E6D4 = offset of FollowOp NPCs - NPC is to the right by default, but will appear to the left, below, and above after jumping systems ~fox
-- 1.5f in common.dll, 0x??????, 0x13E6D0 = autopilot helper value used by all AI functions - set lower for better FollowOp, 1.34 is good ~fox
-- 25000000f in content.dll, 0x??????, 0x1195D4 = square of the distance from the end of the patrol_path to the object over which patrol_path NPCs won't dock with it (so far tested only with jumpgates; raising this may prevent PP crashes?) ~Vital
-- 200f in common.dll, 0x?????, 0x7AE5E = unknown, increasing this to 1000f and more makes patrol_path NPCs stand still after spawn (side note by fox: this range seems to also denote the range which MsnRandEnc ships spawned with story scripting cut cruise and engage targets; if you're spawning ships with MsnRandEnc, try increasing this to make them more combat-effective) ~Vital
-- 2000f in content.dll, 0x??????, 0x11C2CC = max range at which randommission NPCs will engage enemies; outside of this range, their behavior will be strange (fly around in circles, ignore fire, etc.) ~Vital

-- 1.0f in content.dll, 0x11AD84, 0x11BD84 = reputation over which a faction's NPCs will excuse your friendly fire (killing the NPC should still dock rep, however) ~fox
-- 0.6f in content.dll, 0x11AD84, 0x11BD80 = reputation over which a faction will shoot at or be friendly with another faction due to rather player is friendly ~fox
-- "(group name)" in common.dll, 0x143C28, 0x143C58 = list of groups (in nickname form) of factions that won't show up on your reputation screen - either replace the nicknames or write over them with 0x00S (DO NOT change the length of the DLL) ~Bejaymac
