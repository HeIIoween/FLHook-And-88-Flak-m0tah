ENBSeries for GTA San Andreas v0.074f

WARNING! This version works correctly with non-fullscreen viewports, motion blur
vectors are not limited any more, added new parameter ShadowBlurRange to control
bluriness of shadows, FadeDistance to control ambient occlusion distance, UseEnvBump
to deform reflections on cars and two additional parameters for this bump deformations.
For version 0.074e: Added new parameter UsePaletteTexture, now you can change color correction by
custom bitmap image.
For version 0.074d: Activated preset OcclusionQuality for high-end videocards. Added DepthBias parameter.
For version 0.074c: This recompilation based on version 0.074b, solve some bugs and activates
disabled previously functionality. Motion blur effect still works incorrect, but i
decide to let it be, later may be i find out what is wrong. SSAO now have several
parameters, also allow to use ambient occlusion only without indirect lightning for
better performance. SSAO now activated for AlternativeDepth=0. Some problems with
dissapearing and flickering of SSAO and soft shadows now solved. Added shadows
filtering.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
Videocard with support of Shader Model 2.0 or better. Videocards in the list below may fit:
GeForce 6100, 6150, 6200, 6600, 6800, 7300, 7600, 7800, 7900, 8500, 8600, 8800;
Radeon 9500, 9550, 9600, 9700, 9800, 300, 600, 700, 800, 850, 1300, 1600, 1800, 1900, 1950, 2400, 2600, 2900, 3850, 3870.
I can't guarantee that mod will work on all of them by many reasons (different drivers, hardware reduced versions and just because not tested myself). ENBSeries (current version) will not run at all or will not work properly if hardware by any reason not support minimal requirements of the mod. Videocards with lower shader versions capable to work in theory, but they are too slow, no sense. Videocards of new generation (DirectX10 compatible) in common cases works much faster in this mod, than their performance equivalents in DirectX9 games.
The requirements to videomemory size are very high, depends from screen resolution and antialiasing, for example without antialiasing in a mode 1024*768 it cost 64 Mb of videomemory, and for 1280*1024 106 Mb are necessary. Operative memory and processor play an insignificant role, though all should be balanced.
 

GAME COMPATIBILITY:
Mod may work incorrect with some versions of the games, impossible to test it for every game patch and for already modded games. Some types of installed game modifications may conflict with ENBSeries.

INSTALLING:
Extract files from archive in to the game directory or where game execution file exist (.exe). For some games it is in the directories named system, bin, bin32. Warning, some games needs root game directory for mod even if .exe file is not there.

STARTING:
After game start the mod deactivated by default, to activate it use key combination (for GTASA shift+f12 by default).

SETUP:
After first game start with the mod, configuration file enbseries.ini will be created, use it to modify mod setting. Warning, if configuration file will be corrupted in any way, remove it and run mod again.

Key numbers (virtual key codes) available in key_codes.txt or key_codes.htm. In current version of the mod these lists of key codes are hex values, but mod works with decimal, i can't describe now how to convert them, may be later i'll do something.

PROBLEMS SOLVING:
Q: Mod installed, but i don't see any difference.
A: After game start mod is not activated, turn it on by hotkeys (by default SHIFT F12).
Q: When activating the mod, image makes black (objects near the camera).
A: Your videocard not support antialiasing of HDR textures, disable antialiasing in the game and in display driver control panel. Also try to set AllowAntialias=0, BugFixMode=1 or 5, AlternativeDepth=0, if not helps, disable ambient occlusions EnableOcclusion=0.
Q: Computer not responding when mod activated.
A: Perhaps video drivers too old or too new, for example forceware 169.xx and higher (171.xx last tested) working incorrectly woth some HDR textures, use older drivers (162.xx, 163.xx). Also try to change BugFixMode and disable ambient occlusions EnableOcclusion=0.
Q: Car reflections sometimes hiding and flickering.
A: For some videocards you need to set ReflectionDepthBias value to something about 100, depending from hardware. This problem was found on Radeon 2xxx.
Q: From far distance interier and wheels becomes overlapped visible through car.
A: Value of ReflectionDepthBias is too high or it's not required for your videocard.
Q: I have integrated onboard videochip and mod not works.
A: Perhaps video memory size is too small for display resolution you are playing, decrease it or in bios setting increase video memory size (typically values from 16 to 128 Mb).
Q: At high resolutions and antialiasing mod not works.
A: Not enough video memory.


PERFORMANCE TIPS:
Do not use too high display resolution with ambient occlusion enabled, this effect directly depends from number of pixels on the screen.
By setting UseWaterDeep=0, UseOcclusions=0, ShadowQuality=2 rendering of the scene to depth deactivating and performance greatly increase.
Reflections with some imported car models may work very slow, because of too many polygons that currently proceeded several times, just wait for next releases, rendering reflections with cars itself will be done later.
Bloom almost not decrease game speed, use it as you wish.
Any filtering, for shadows or for ambient occlusions are very slow, try to set their quality=2 and check framerate, may be it will be good for you.
OcclusionQuality=0 set only if your videocard is realy fast, this is the most performance costly. By setting this parameter to 0 you may olso decrease filtering quality to 1 or even 2.
