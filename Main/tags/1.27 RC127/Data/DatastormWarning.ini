[DSWarning]
HeadLine = SPOILER WARNING
OK = I don't like exploring
Cancel = I want to find things myself
Text = I made this mod hoping to make it as enjoyable as I could. Part of this includes secret
systems, items, etc. While much of it is 'rare' and must be earned by killing ships, I _have_
hidden a few things. I made these in mind that people be helping each-other out to take on
the challenge of finding such things, not sitting down with some cheat program and putting to
waste what could be a few hours worth of _your_ fun, especially with others.

If you havn't found everything, I ask of you to please shut this, jump on a server, and play.
If I find that everyone's just abusing the cool stuff to find becuase they used datastorm,
then I probably won't bother making cool stuff to find in the first place. And with the other
stuff I have to do with this mod anyway, I'm not lieing there.

I _will_ take cool stuff out if I find it's been found using cheats. I hope you take this into
consideration and close this.
