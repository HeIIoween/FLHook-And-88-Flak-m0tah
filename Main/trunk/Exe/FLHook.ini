; general settings
; AddOnCharChange: whether players who switch chars while in a group should be re-added to that group after switch
; AlternateRepairTime: sets the total time it takes a base to be repaired, in seconds, for the alternate damagable
;					base repair method.  Non even values will be rounded up.
; AlternateRepairTimeRatio: The ratio between the time repairing and the time after the solar is killed when
;					nothing is done.  For example, 0.5 would make the two times equal and 0.3 would make the time
;					before repairing 30% of AlternateRepairTime.
; AlternateMaxRepair: the maximum percent of health to repair to for the alternate repair.  For example, setting
;					to 1.0 would repair all the way and .75 to 75%.
; AntiDockKill:     anti-dockkilling time in ms, starts when player has completely undocked and is able to fly freely.
;                   while being dockkill-protected, the player can't be damaged by other players and can't damage
;                   other players himself
; AntiF1:           anti-f1 time in ms. f1 pushing in will be delayed for this amount of time if player is in space.
;                   the client won't see what happens while delaying. (set to 0 to disable)
; AutoMarkRadius:	the default /automark radius in KMs; set to a negative number to disable the command.
; BaseDockDamagePrevent: The damage ratio at which docking is not allowed at bases/docking rings.
;					For example, 0.4 would deny docking if the base has less than 40% of its health.
; BeamCmdBehavior:	Controls what method the .beam command uses to beam players.
;					0: Original FLHook 1.5.5 behavior.
;					1: FLHook plugin version behavior.
;					2: Original FLHook 1.5.5 behavior + kick after beam.
;					3: Redirects .beam to .kbeam.
; ChangeCruiseDisruptorBehaviour:
;                   set it to yes and cruise disruptors will no longer affect the engine kill
; CollisionDamageNPCs: set it to yes and NPCs will be damaged by collisions with players.
;				NOTE: Do not set except for testing purposes, setting is still buggy.
; DisconnectDelay:  similar to anti-f1, applies when player disconnects while being in space. the player's ship will
;                   remain in space for this amount of time when he disconnects. within this period he can't
;                   reconnect to the server("your account is already in use" will be displayed)
; DisableCharfileEncryption: disables charfile-encryption(will be saved in plain ascii-text). this may lead to some
;                            problems with programs like ioncross! setting keeps active when unloading FLHook with
;                            the "unload" command.
; DisableNPCSpawns: disables all npc-spawns while the serverload is bigger than this value. this does not affect
;                   mission npcs! it allows you to dynamically adjust the number of npcs (set to 0 to disable)
; DropShieldsCloak: set it to yes and the player's shield will drop upon execution of /cloak (shields will regenerate as usual)
; Is88Flak:         setting that controls certain features in this FLHook version specific to Flak, including
;                   - not automarking ships of type = CAPITAL
;                   - /botcombat command
; MaxGroupSize:     change the maximum group size(default is 8)
; MaxRepValue:		The maximum value that rep can be set (only affects rep changed from PvP and through the
;					setreprelative command).
; MinRepValue:		The minimum value that rep can be set (only affects rep changed from PvP and through the
;					setreprelative command).
; MobileDockRadius: the radius within a mobile base is dockable, in meters.  Set to -1 to disable /dock.
; MobileDockOffset: the distance over or under the carrier players are undocked from other players.
; RenameCmdCharge:	the amount of cash that a player is charged to use the /rename command.  Set to -1 to disable the command.
; RestartServerOpt: command line options to pass to FLServer.exe when restarting the server via the .restartserver command
; SendcashTax:		The tax percentage charged to transfers done with the /sendcash user command; decimal
;					values are accepted.  Set to -1 to disable the command.
; SendcashTime:		The time in minutes that the player needs to have played in order to use the /sendcash command.
; ShieldsUpTime:	The time after the shieldsdown command during which the shieldsup command can be used.
; SpinProtectionMass: If a player's ship's mass is >= than this, it will be protected from being spun by NPCs.
;					Set to -1 to disable the spin protection.
; SpinProtectionMultiplier: Controls the strength of the NPC spin protection.
; TransferCmdCharge: the amount of cash a player is charged to use the /transfer command.  Set to -1 to disable the command.
