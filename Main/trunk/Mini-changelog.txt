-- Removed the tutorial script, as was not working very well with high player counts and may have been leading to crashes (this was the RC129 Hotfix Patch).
-- Fixed the in-game 3D Sound Notice.
-- Roaming AI Bot presense has been increased. Bot relations are now a little more important.
-- AI Wingmen are no longer considered Bots, and as such no longer print death messages when they die.
-- Adjustments to the AI chase-targets-in-cruise behavior that should help stop some of the random NPC disappearance issues.
-- Improved the general responsiveness of death fuses. Effects now start as soon as the death fuse starts, and while the effect firing remains randomized, there is always an explosion right at the start of the fuse.

Also, the test wingmen scripts have been removed. If you really want to play with them, copy the contents of Wingmen - Script.txt in the m13 folder to your m13.ini - please note that you'll have to add the "init" triggers of each script to the "init_all" trigger at the top of m13.ini

What's sorta todo:
-- change AI Bots to only spawn around a buoy in the arenas?
-- find out what's up with Transport etc. CC drops (I think they're actually fleeing out of the 5k range)
-- somehow balance shipclass spawning (make VHFs their own class (mixed with all others) and assign them to only assault encs)
-- Implement basic rewards for the existing challenge systems, and perhaps finish some of the other ideas.
-- eventually do a bunch of other updates to the readme
-- Internal rename of version!

What's not really todo but should be done eventually:
-- moors for AI ships? - it works as expected, however I'm not totally sure I like it
-- FLSM script the PBase thingies (a blind append wouldn't be very good though)
-- Create missiles for the Nomad Fighter.
-- Create a "Nomad Repair Ship", essentially a copypasta of the current Repair Ship but with a Nomad Fighter model for RP purposes. In place of the RS's 360* Class 3 mounts and shield, the Nomad RS will simply have a single Nomad Laser mount, and no shield. The Repair Beam will function identically. In practice, the Nomad RS will be a more offensive version of the stock RS, but will be more easily killed.
-- test out EMP ship - may be able to wedge it in as a VHF varient
-- rebalance the security rating weight on spawns - eh maybe later good enough for now
-- sniper turrets need balancing - I have a feeling they're overpowered
-- create VHF varients of Anubis and Serafina, 'cause I can
-- missile explode distances?
--- look at something for LRMs, as they're short-range now (maybe, but they're powerful)
-- look into better solution for base drops
-- pilot stuff
-- fix up prisoners to pilot stuff standards (if implemented)

Stuff I should do but don't really want to:
-- further redo AI loadouts to have all CDs on LFs and all Torps on HFs? Nah
-- interfaction relations - establish a base for each relation (look at ids_infos) and standardize the empathies
-- better AI loadouts - looks like it's time to finally do a pool and churn out some loadouts (hey, maybe this will actually happen soon!)

What was done and might be done again:
-- Being friendly to one house, while hostile to another, will now cause some interesting diplomacy to occur between military forces. Liberty pirate seeking shelter in Kusari space? They might help you out with an off-the-record engagement or two; just try not to start a war over it.

Hook wishlist:
-- dockkill/apvptoken protection messages for when you shoot a player - "You can not damage this player because of (x reason)"
-- Rep changes for station deaths
-- additional combat-only logout delay so logging out in combat will take even longer
-- possibly .kill torpedoes launched at a velocity > 600m/s?
-- FREIGHTER is not automarked when /automark is enabled
-- have player kills log a "follow_trigger_ship" archetype_killed if possible
-- /automark max range set to max range of current scanner?
-- I can haz NPC cloaking?
