-- Major improvements to functionality and stability of MP mission scripting, thanks to M0tah.

Important Notes:
-- In this beta build, Mission_13 features a small tutorial (with placeholder text strings) that throws basic hostiles at the player. This tutorial is planned to guide new players through 88 Flak's new features, and ease them into the new combat mechanics.
-- If you edit a charfile (or mpnewcharacter.fl) to start on Mission_10 or Mission_09, you will be able to test the new AI Wingmen system.
   -- Setting it to Mission_10 will cause a foxBot and KittBot token to appear when you first launch. Shoot either one - or both - of these tokens to spawn your escort(s).
   -- Setting it to Mission_09 will cause a Wo3dy and ChipBot token to appear when you first launch. Shoot either one - or both - of these tokens to spawn your escort(s).
   -- If you are going to test the wingmen with multiple people, it works best if one person is on Mission_10, one person is on Mission_09, and everyone else is on the normal Mission_13. If everyone one is on Mission_10 or Mission_09, it won't crash, but if multiple players spawn a wingman squad there will start being order conflicts.
   -- Once spawned, wingmen can be ordered by opening the Cargo Scan window twice (tap "Scan Cargo" key three times).
-- Finally, you may notice normal AI Wingmen (hirable by tokens etc.) don't follow very well. This is because I undid all my NPC Follow-related hacks for the purposes of mission scripting.

What's sorta todo:
-- fix the death_comm thing
-- fifth EMP missile for pi_empmissile effect
-- hull-regen on Power Modulators?
-- change "Freighter" and "ship" IDSs
-- Reduce Torpedo splash damage radius to original RC126/RC127 values.
-- Raise hull-regen to 100 on the Repair Ship.
-- Allow VHF to mount weapons over its CD / Torpedo mounts. Don't know if the powerplant will be changed yet.
-- Raise Nomad Fighter Nanobot limit to 20; raise hull-regen to 80.
-- Bring Nomad Fighter weaponry in-line with Class 5-7 weapons.
-- Create missiles for the Nomad Fighter.
-- Create a "Nomad Repair Ship", essentially a copypasta of the current Repair Ship but with a Nomad Fighter model for RP purposes. In place of the RS's 360* Class 3 mounts and shield, the Nomad RS will simply have two normal Nomad Laser mounts, and no shield. The Repair Beam will function identically. In practice, the Nomad RS will be a more offensive version of the stock RS, but will be more easily killed.
-- Turn the Faction Tag Removal NPC into a dealer that sells all Player-Purchasable Bases. Bartenders will still sell nearby PPBs.
-- Prevent commodities from being traded / dropped at all in Alaska, to correct trading exploits. (this will require some FLHook work)
-- Change challenge systems to use Credit Chips instead of Kill Tokens, allowing Kill Tokens to remain as a simple way to track your AI kill streak. This way, you can easily spot someone else the Credit Chips they'd need to enter the system, allowing one person to pay for a whole group's entry if he/she so desired.
-- Implement basic rewards for the existing challenge systems, and perhaps finish some of the other ideas.
-- cloaks need an IDS name for .enumcargo, I think
-- test out EMP ship - may be able to wedge it in as a VHF varient
-- Internal rename of version!

What's not really todo but should be done eventually:
-- rebalance the security rating weight on spawns - eh maybe later good enough for now
-- sniper turrets need balancing - I have a feeling they're overpowered
-- create VHF varients of Anubis and Serafina, 'cause I can
-- missile explode distances?
-- double damage / power usage for guns! (no really)
--- look at something for LRMs, as they're short-range now (maybe, but they're powerful)
--- moors for AI ships? - it works as expected, however I'm not totally sure I like it
-- rework server options into mTrigger IDSs? Even worth it?
-- Implement the new AI Bots (will likely end up with 30+ AI Bots!)
-- eventually update documentation on Alaska and Mine Mazathon changes
-- eventually update readme about source material
-- look into better solution for base drops
-- pilot stuff
-- fix up prisoners to pilot stuff standards (if implemented)

Stuff I should do but don't really want to:
-- further redo AI loadouts to have all CDs on LFs and all Torps on HFs? Nah
-- interfaction relations - establish a base for each relation (look at ids_infos) and standardize the empathies
-- better AI loadouts - looks like it's time to finally do a pool and churn out some loadouts (hey, maybe this will actually happen soon!)

What was done and might be done again:
-- Being friendly to one house, while hostile to another, will now cause some interesting diplomacy to occur between military forces. Liberty pirate seeking shelter in Kusari space? They might help you out with an off-the-record engagement or two; just try not to start a war over it.

Hook wishlist:
-- dockkill/apvptoken protection messages for when you shoot a player - "You can not damage this player because of (x reason)"
-- Rep changes for station deaths
-- additional combat-only logout delay so logging out in combat will take even longer
-- possibly .kill torpedoes launched at a velocity > 600m/s?
-- FREIGHTER is not automarked when /automark is enabled
-- have player kills log a "follow_trigger_ship" archetype_killed if possible
-- /automark max range set to max range of current scanner?
-- I can haz NPC cloaking?
