; AntiDockKill:     anti-dockkilling time in ms, starts when player has completely undocked and is able to fly freely.
;                   while being dockkill-protected, the player can't be damaged by other players and can't damage
;                   other players himself
; BaseDockDamagePrevent: The damage ratio at which docking is not allowed at bases/docking rings.  
;					For example, 0.4 would deny docking if the base has less than 40% of its health.
